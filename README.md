### Explanation

- **Project Structure:** The project is organized into `data_structures` for advanced algorithms like segment trees and heaps, `modules` for functional components like budgeting, expense monitoring, investment evaluation, and the financial advisor itself.
  
- **Main Program (`main.py`):** Provides a user-friendly interface using Python's input functions to interact with the `FinancialAdvisor` class. Users can update their budget, add expenses, evaluate investments, and view financial metrics in real-time.
